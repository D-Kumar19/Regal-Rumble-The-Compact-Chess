# Regal Rumble: The Compact Chess Challenge

Welcome to **Regal Rumble: The Compact Chess Challenge**, an innovative game that distills the essence of traditional chess into a compact and fast-paced format. Unlike the classic chess board of 8x8 squares, **Regal Rumble** is played on a smaller 2x3 board, making for a quicker and more strategic game.

## Features

- **Compact Board:** Experience chess like never before on a 2x3 board that challenges your strategic skills in a confined space.
- **Limited Pieces:** Each player controls one King, one Bishop, and one Rook, necessitating innovative tactics and movements.
- **Focused Gameplay:** The primary objective is to maneuver your King from one corner of the board to the opposite corner.
- **Efficiency Challenge:** The game is won by achieving the objective in the least number of moves possible. The current record stands at 11 moves. Can you beat it?

## How to Play

1. **Setup:** The board is set up with each player's King, Bishop, and Rook placed on their respective starting squares.
2. **Objective:** Move your King from its starting corner to the opposite corner of the board.
3. **Rules:** 
   - Each player takes turns moving one piece at a time.
   - The Bishop and Rook move according to traditional chess rules, but within the confines of the smaller board.
   - One square on the board is always left empty to allow for piece movement.
4. **Winning:** Successfully move your King to the opposite corner in the fewest moves possible.
